### What I learned

I am still beginner in creating my own mixins or extends. But I try to use it in this project. 
I used the extend for the "details" part with icons. I defined the style of one item and then I extend it with icon image.



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="details container">
        <h2 class="sr-only">Details list</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="details__icon--compatible">
            <h3>Highly compatible</h3>
            <p>
              Easy to use and works well with all major computer brands, gaming
              consoles and mobile devices. Plug & play, no installation or
              driver needed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="details__icon--bluetooth">
            <h3>Wireless with bluetooth</h3>
            <p>
              Powerful 2.4G RF technology allows you to connect the cordless
              keyboard from up to 30ft away. Simply plug the unifying receiver
              into your computer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="details__icon--battery">
            <h3>High capacity battery</h3>
            <p>
              Equipped with a long-lasting built-in battery, you‚Äôll never have
              to spend a dime on replaceable ones. Enjoy 40 hours of usage time
              between charges.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="details__icon--light">
            <h3>RGB backlit modes</h3>
            <p>
              Choose from 4 backlight brightness levels and adjustable breathing
              speed. Each key glows intensely in the dark and helps you type in
              low light conditions.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
```

```css
&__icon--compatible:before {
    content: "";
    width: 4.0625rem;
    height: 4.0625rem;
    display: inline-block;
    border-radius: 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 3rem;
    background-image: url("./../assets/shared/icon-compatible.svg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center center;
    background-color: abstracts.$primary-500;
  }

  &__icon--bluetooth:before {
    @extend .details__icon--compatible;
    background-image: url("./../assets/shared/icon-bluetooth.svg");
  }

  &__icon--battery:before {
    @extend .details__icon--compatible;
    background-image: url("./../assets/shared/icon-battery.svg");
  }

  &__icon--light:before {
    @extend .details__icon--compatible;
    background-image: url("./../assets/shared/icon-light.svg");
  }
```



### Continued development

I made this project after the long time and I need to remind some things. For the next challenges I would like to use some advanced techniques of SASS.
